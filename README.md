# brew_share
## Motive
1. Utilize and expand knowledge of REACT
1. Build a REACT client for an api I built from scratch

## What is brew__share?
brew_share is a digital coffee diary. Users can enter a coffee they've brewed, and the specific steps they followed. I enjoy trying different varieties of coffee, and have several different ways of brewing coffee (aeropress, chemex, single-serve pourover), but it can be hard to remember what combinations yielded the best results. brew_share aims to provide an easy place to journal your daily coffee.
